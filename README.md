# RemindMe

## Description

In the world of many troubles, distractions and stuff, maintaining an upbeat spirit is priceless. RemindMe is inspired by the need to have all our favourite sayings in one place, which serves as a source of inspiration and motivation to remain focused and productive throughout the day. RemindMe aims to literally remind users of all the things - WHY?s, quotes, pictures, events, memories - that mean so much to them and which elate their spirit in one place. These are called 'reminders'.

RemindMe is a user-friendly web application designed to help users manage their 'reminders' efficiently. It provides features such as user authentication, reminder creation, updating, deletion, and profile management with image uploads.
